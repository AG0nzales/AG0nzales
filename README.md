Andre Gonzales is the name,  a graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. <br>
A software developer based in Davao City, Philippines.<br>
Currently, I'm all about crafting cool things on the web and diving into technologies that jazz up the developer experience! <br>
My unforgettable milestone and beginning of the developer journey was that I got to represent my country and university in a conference presentation in japan [AICCC 2022](https://uic.startbox.ph/bs-computer-science-students-presents-research-in-osaka-japan/).<br>
In my downtime, you'll catch me diving into the world of making music, watching anime, and  reading manga.
